# ChatGPT Avatar Remover

ChatGPT Avatar Remover is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to enhance your chat experience by removing avatars from ChatGPT conversations, which I find distracting. This is by no means revolutionary, it's more a project to see how difficult it is to put something on the chrome store.

## Installation

You can install ChatGPT Avatar Remover directly from the Chrome Web Store. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the [ChatGPT Avatar Remover Extension](#) page on the Chrome Web Store.
2. Click the "Add to Chrome" button.
3. Confirm the installation when prompted.

The extension will be added to your Chrome browser, and you can start using it immediately.
